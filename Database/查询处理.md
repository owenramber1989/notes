# Query Models

Iterator model 和 materialization model是两个极端

vectorization model就很合适

这三种都是pull based, 而与pull-based不一样，push-based需要一个全局调度器, 一个dispatcher

# Query Schedule

## GOALS

#1 Throughput
#2 Fairness (no query is starved)
#3 Query Responsiveness(minimize the tail latency)
#4 Minimize Overhead

NUMA架构

When the DBMS calls malloc and the allocator doesn't already have a chunk of memory that it can give out. So it will extend the process's data segment. But this piece of memory is only virtual memory and not supported by physical memory. The OS only allocates memory when there is page fault on access.
