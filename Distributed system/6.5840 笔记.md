## Fault tolerance

我们不考虑系统本身的bug，以及correlated errors, we only care for the fault stop failure.

Strategy 1: State transfer, to make way for the backup to replay

Strategy 2: Replicated state machine

they do not send the state, they just send the external inputs/events. Since the state are deterministic if we don't care about the external inputs. i.e. The input and output of an exact instruction are normally the same though there do exist the instructions which produces randomized results.

We prefer 2 since it send operations rather than states cuz the states are usually smaller.
However, state transfer is more robust in the face of multi-core and parallelism since the interleaving of different cores are basically non-deterministic.

The 5 questions to be discussed:

1. How do we define the states?
2. primary/backup sync cost
3. cut over cost
4. anomalies handle
5. new replicas cost

The vm-ft replicates at the low-level of memory and machine registers and not matter what the softwares that we use. It's quite unique.

The backup also generate output, while the NIC just dropped the packet anyway.

There is a log entries channel between the primary and the backup. If the backup do not receive any log entry for the limit of timeout. Then it assumes the primary was dead or some other case. The backup ***GO LIVE***
